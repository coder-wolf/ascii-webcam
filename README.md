# ascii-webcam

How to run it on your machine:

- [ ] Make sure you have ```opencv``` installed on your machine.
- [ ] Change the terminal's font size to as low as possible, (I'm using fontsize 2)
- [ ] Change the terminal window to fullscreen. (I'm using -> 1255x244 (1255 charecters by 244 charecters), on my machine)
- [ ] type ```python3 cli-app.py``` inside the project directory to run python code

If everything works as expected, you should be able to see the webcam feed inside your terminal.

NB: It was tested on unix. For windows
